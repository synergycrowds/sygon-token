<a href="https://github.com/mocamircea/sygon-token/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Documentation of the SYGON token.</a>

Terms: the SynergyCrowds company will be further referred in this document with "the company".

The use of the SYGON token will be exclusive, after a transition period during which the token is listed in exchange mechanisms to make it available to the wide public.

<h2>Mission</h2>
The company is engaged in building the sustainability of the SYGON technology and its products in the long term. The company is mostly involved into management processes with the objective of bringing the prouducts to the market and building their financial sustainability in the long term.

<h2>Resources</h2>
Commitment: the company is using its resources entirely for realizing its mission.

The company has the following sources of revenue:

<h3>Quota from token releases</h3>
For operating the products, the company receives for each project developed by contributors a quota of the released amount of tokens. Currently the value of quota is 50% but this value is subject of change.

<h3>Quota in revenues</h3>
The products are built by contributors and operated by the company, generating revenues. The company receives a quota of the realized revenues through automatic mechanisms. The <a href="The company is using these amounts entirely for realizing its mission.">transfers of revenue distribution</a> are operated simultaneously to the company and other contributors.

<h3>Quota from the collected fees</h3>
After the entire supply of SYGON tokens has been released, a quota of the collected fees will be transferred periodically by the Fee Manager to the company. The Fee Manager is a software mechanism that allows all sygons to decide through voting over the value of the quota of the collected fees to be transferred to the company.

Also, the company is supported with resources from the founders of the SynergyCrowds project. The company is currently self funded.

<h2>Token sale</h2>
The company will sell SYGON tokens directly or through exchange mechanisms to anyone interested. The maximum supply of tokens that the company can put on sale is limited to the amounts <a href="https://github.com/mocamircea/sygon-token#12-transferastokenrelease">received as token release</a>.

<h2>Pricing</h2>
The company is currently responsible for pricing the operated products. In later phases of development of the SYGON technology the contributors will gain a high degree of involvement in pricing the products. However, the objective of the company is to build synergy with all contributors, maximizing the generated revenues but also ensuring accessibility of users to the operated products.
